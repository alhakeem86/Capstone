      <p class="MsoNormal">
        <strong>Cerebral Palsy (CP)</strong> is a term describing a group of
        permanent movement and posture disorders caused by a non-progressive
        injury to the immature brain. It is the most prevalent cause of physical
        impairment in children. In addition, persons with CP may also have
        epilepsy and difficulties of cognition, communication, feeding, vision
        or hearing, as well as secondary musculoskeletal problems
      </p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    The prevalence of CP is around 2 per 1000 live births. Based on neurologic
    findings CP is divided in 3 sub-types<sup>2</sup>, all of which have in
    common an abnormal pattern of movement and posture:
  </p>
  <h4 id="zaza" align="left">Spastic CP</h4>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
    Increased muscle tone with the presence of pathological reflexes
  </p>
  <h4 id="zaza" align="left">Dyskinetic CP</h4>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
    Involuntary, uncontrolled, repetitive and sometimes stereotype movements
  </p>
  <h4 id="zaza" align="left">Ataxic CP</h4>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
    Loss of normal muscle coordination, so movement with abnormal strength,
    rhythm and precision such as hypermetrics (missing the object of the
    intended movement) and dysdiadochokinetics (not being able to alternate
    quickly a direction of movement)
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
    Mobility and self-initiated movement abilities can be classified according
    to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)<sup>3</sup>. All
    children with CP can be classified in five different levels:
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    <strong>Level 1</strong>: only limitations in advanced gross motor skills
    (running, jumping, hopping)
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    <strong>Level 2</strong>: walks without aid; limitation in walking outside
    and in direct surroundings of home environment
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    <strong>Level 3</strong>: walks with aid, limitations in walking outside and
    in direct surroundings of home environment
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    <strong>Level 4</strong>: moves independently with limitations: children are
    transported or use manual or electric wheelchair
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    <strong>Level 5</strong>: severely limited independent movement, even with
    the use of aids
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    There may also exist problems with vision, hearing, sensation, cognition or
    seizures. The origin of the brain lesion is often unknown. Recognised risk
    factors include prematurity, infection during pregancy or early postnatal
    life. Among others, complications at delivery and head trauma in early life
    are known risk factors.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    The diagnostic process is conducted by clinicians and often involves blood
    analysis and medical imagery (ultrasound, MRI scans etc.).
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    Treatment is best organised and executed by multidisciplinary teams
    according to their local facilities. Early treatment that is individualised
    and adapted to the needs of the family brings the best long-term results.
    The aim is optimal participation in everyday life.
