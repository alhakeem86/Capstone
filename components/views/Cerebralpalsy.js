    <h2 class="za">What is Cerebral Palsy?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Cerebral Palsy (CP)</strong> is a term describing a group of
      permanent movement and posture disorders caused by a non-progressive
      injury to the immature brain. It is the most prevalent cause of physical
      impairment in children. In addition, persons with CP may also have
      epilepsy and difficulties of cognition, communication, feeding, vision or
      hearing, as well as secondary musculoskeletal problems
    </p>
    <img class="ho-img" src="${myImage}" />
  </div>
  <div class="simple">
    <p>
      The prevalence of CP is around 2 per 1000 live births. Based on neurologic
      findings CP is divided in 3 sub-types<sup>2</sup>, all of which have in
      common an abnormal pattern of movement and posture:
    </p>
    <h4>Spastic CP</h4>
    <p>
      Increased muscle tone with the presence of pathological reflexes
    </p>
    <h4>Dyskinetic CP</h4>
    <p>
      Involuntary, uncontrolled, repetitive and sometimes stereotype movements
    </p>
    <h4>Ataxic CP</h4>
    <p>
      Loss of normal muscle coordination, so movement with abnormal strength,
      rhythm and precision such as hypermetrics (missing the object of the
      intended movement) and dysdiadochokinetics (not being able to alternate
      quickly a direction of movement)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mobility and self-initiated movement abilities can be classified according
      to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)<sup>3</sup>. All
      children with CP can be classified in five different levels:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Level 1</strong>: only limitations in advanced gross motor skills
      (running, jumping, hopping)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Level 2</strong>: walks without aid; limitation in walking outside
      and in direct surroundings of home environment
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Level 3</strong>: walks with aid, limitations in walking outside
      and in direct surroundings of home environment
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Level 4</strong>: moves independently with limitations: children
      are transported or use manual or electric wheelchair
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Level 5</strong>: severely limited independent movement, even with
      the use of aids
    </p>
    <p>
      There may also exist problems with vision, hearing, sensation, cognition
      or seizures. The origin of the brain lesion is often unknown. Recognised
      risk factors include prematurity, infection during pregancy or early
      postnatal life. Among others, complications at delivery and head trauma in
      early life are known risk factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diagnostic process is conducted by clinicians and often involves blood
      analysis and medical imagery (ultrasound, MRI scans etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Treatment is best organised and executed by multidisciplinary teams
      according to their local facilities. Early treatment that is
      individualised and adapted to the needs of the family brings the best
      long-term results. The aim is optimal participation in everyday life.

    <h2 class="za">Diagnosing Cerebral Palsy</h2>
    <p>
      Diagnosing cerebral palsy (CP) has not always been an easy path. In the
      past physicians would “wait and see” how the child developed before making
      a diagnosis. This left families in a state of limbo wondering about their
      child’s development. There are now standard evaluations of movement that
      can be used with existing tests and tools to decide with high accuracy,
      and in some cases in infancy, if a cerebral palsy diagnosis is
      appropriate. Not all children who miss developmental milestones have
      cerebral palsy. Screening for cerebral palsy should be done when a child
      has risk factors for developing cerebral palsy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>How is Cerebral Palsy Diagnosed?</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Your child’s medical team will decide when to give your child a diagnosis
      of cerebral palsy, or decide if they are at high risk for CP. These
      clinicians may include a pediatrician, developmental specialist,
      rehabilitation physician, neurologist, or any other specialty physician
      needed to support the care and wellbeing of your child. One or more of
      these doctors will determine (or you may ask) if your child is at high
      risk for cerebral palsy by collecting the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Watching and examining your child’s movement patterns and using a
        combination of standardized movement assessments (ie GMA, HINE, AYC)
      </li>
      <li>Reviewing their medical history</li>
      <li>Evaluating their muscle tone, reflexes, and posture</li>
      <li>
        Considering whether your child has common risk factors for cerebral
        palsy
      </li>
      <li>
        Asking if your child has missed multiple developmental milestones (ex.
        delays in rolling over, sitting independently, pulling to a stand and
        reaching out for objects)
      </li>
      <li>
        Getting your input on feeding, vision, hearing, language, cognitive
        functioning, behavior and social skills
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      The information from those evaluations will be looked at along with
      imaging of the child’s brain, also known as an MRI. Other tests may
      include genetic, metabolic or a combination of both.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Standardized Movement Assessment Tools for Diagnosing Cerebral Palsy
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      The latest research states that a diagnosis for cerebral palsy may
      sometimes be made earlier than 6 months corrected age (baby’s age minus
      the number of weeks the baby was preterm). Standardized infant movement
      assessments may be used at different ages, and with other medical
      evaluations like the MRI, to determine whether a diagnosis of cerebral
      palsy is accurate. Some of the standardized movement assessments that may
      be used for diagnosing cerebral palsy (or high risk for cerebral palsy)
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>General Movements Assessment (GMA)</li>
      <li>Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam (HINE)</li>
      <li>Developmental Assessment of Young Children (DAYC)</li>
      <li>Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Importance of Early Diagnosis</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      A diagnosis of cerebral palsy should be made as early as possible. Access
      to support and services while the brain is still in early development is
      important to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Take advantage of the brain’s early ability to change, also known as
        neuroplasticity, to maximize the child’s movement and cognitive
        outcomes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Early and ongoing monitoring for common musculoskeletal complications
        can help prevent hip displacement, contractures, and scoliosis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce caregiver anxiety and stress associated with an extended period
        of not knowing their child’s diagnosis. By having a diagnosis early,
        parents may gain support from peers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Receiving a diagnosis of cerebral palsy feels overwhelming. Coping with
      the diagnosis will become easier over time with professional guidance and
      peer support. Having a diagnosis puts you in the best position to help
      your child. It allows you to access appropriate therapies and treatments,
      and it gives you a way to organize your thoughts and actions.

    <h2 class="za">Causes of Cerebral Palsy</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Cerebral palsy can be caused by a brain injury or an interference in brain
      development. Sometimes these disturbances occur because of genetic
      changes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Conditions that are Associated with an Increased Risk for Cerebral Palsy
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      This is a list of conditions currently known to increase the risk of, or
      cause, cerebral palsy, however, with ongoing research, this can change.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maternal infection</li>
      <li>Infant stroke</li>
      <li>Multiple births</li>
      <li>Premature birth</li>
      <li>
        Other issues affecting how blood and oxygen move throughout the
        developing brain
      </li>
      <li>Bleeding in the brain before, during, or after birth</li>
      <li>Infections of the brain, including meningitis or encephalitis</li>
      <li>
        Shock, a state in which organs and tissues do not receive adequate blood
        flow
      </li>
      <li>Traumatic brain injuries, such as from a serious car accident</li>
      <li>Seizures at birth or in the first month following birth</li>
      <li>Certain genetic conditions</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Diagnosing cerebral palsy involves the use of multiple examinations and
      tools. Some of these tools include an analysis of the infant’s movements
      (ie GMA, HINE and TIMP etc), imaging of the brain, and physical
      examinations of muscle tone. Although any one risk factor may cause
      cerebral palsy, more often it is caused by the presence of multiple risk
      factors.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Research Highlights Regarding Causes of Cerebral Palsy</h3>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        The research literature suggests that events during pregnancy are more
        likely to cause cerebral palsy than events during labor or delivery.
      </li>
      <li>
        A major US study, called the Collaborative Perinatal Project, conducted
        between 1959 and 1974 followed approximately 50,000 women and their
        children from the first prenatal visit until the children were seven
        years old. It found that events during labor and delivery were not major
        contributors to the occurrence of cerebral palsy; most cases had their
        origins before labor began. A second finding was that intrauterine
        inflammation was a major cause of adverse pregnancy outcome
      </li>
      <li>
        At least 70 percent of cases of cerebral palsy have antecedents* during
        pregnancy, and only 10 to 20 percent of cases are related to the child’s
        birth
      </li>
      <li>
        Neither the routine use of fetal monitoring during labor nor the
        increased incidence of caesarean births (factors which reduce risk
        during labor and delivery) have reduced the number of cases of cerebral
        palsy
      </li>
      <li>
        Most brain injuries which cause cerebral palsy occur in the second half
        of pregnancy, a period when the rate of brain development is fastest
      </li>
      <li>
        Some risk factors are on the decline, but others are increasing[2][3].
        Advances in neonatal care have reduced the risk of birth injury.
        However, with these advances more preterm infants, and infants with low
        birth weight, are surviving, some of whom may develop cerebral palsy.
      </li>
      <li>
        The fact that some risk factors are decreasing while others are
        increasing is leading to a change in the type of cerebral palsy that
        develops. For example, an injury to the brain at 24 weeks can have a
        different effect than one at 28 weeks or 36 weeks. Until recently,
        babies born at 24 weeks would not have survived. Now, thankfully, many
        of these babies survive; however, some may develop cerebral palsy.
      </li>
      <li>
        The most common types of cerebral palsy differ in different parts of the
        world, depending on risk factors.
      </li>
      <li>
        In approximately 90 percent of cases, cerebral palsy results from
        healthy brain tissue becoming damaged rather than from abnormalities in
        brain development
      </li>
      <li>
        Confirmation of the presence of a brain injury by magnetic resonance
        imaging (MRI) occurs in many, but not all cases. Up to 17 percent of
        people with cerebral palsy have normal MRI brain scans[4]. Imaging may
        also help determine when the brain injury occurred
      </li>
      <li>
        The cause of cerebral palsy in an individual child is often unknown
      </li>
    </ul>
