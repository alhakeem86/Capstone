    <h2 class="za">15 Effective Exercises for Adults with Cerebral Palsy</h2>
    <br />
    <img class="ho-img" src="${myImage}" />
    <br />
    <p>
      The most effective exercises for adults with cerebral palsy will help them
      become as functional as possible and prevent secondary complications from
      worsening. This article will share 15 effective exercises for individuals
      with cerebral palsy and their benefits.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Why Exercises for Adults with Cerebral Palsy Are Important</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Exercising can increase range of motion, reduce the risk of depression,
      help you maintain a healthy weight, promote circulation, and keep your
      musculoskeletal system strong. <br />

      Because effects of cerebral palsy like spasticity (high muscle tone) can
      worsen over time, it’s essential to exercise to minimize their
      progression. <br />

      Everyone experiences cerebral palsy differently; therefore, a personalized
      approach to therapy is ideal. A physical therapist will access your
      functional abilities and create a custom rehabilitation plan. <br />

      Focus on the exercises you can do for challenge rather than frustration.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Exercises to Boost Flexibility and Increase Range of Motion</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Stretching is one of the most important exercises for individuals with
      cerebral palsy. A muscle must stretch before it can strengthen. Stretching
      expands range of motion, reduces stiffness, lengthens tight muscles, and
      relieves pain.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>1. Joint Rotations</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      To expand or maintain a healthy range of motion, perform rotations on all
      your major joints and the neck. <br />

      This includes the:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hips</li>
      <li>Knees</li>
      <li>Ankle</li>
      <li>Shoulders</li>
      <li>Elbows</li>
      <li>Wrists</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Rotate them in one direction a few times, and then switch to the opposite
      direction. This will combat stiffness and promote circulation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>2. Calf Stretch</h3>
    <img class="ex-img" src="${myImage1}" />
    <br />
    <p>
      Many individuals with cerebral palsy experience spasticity (involuntary
      muscle contractions) in their calves. <br />
      <br />
      This can pull the heels up and result in abnormal gait patterns like
      toe-walking. <br />
      <br />
      To lengthen tight calves, stand facing a wall and take a big step back
      with one leg. Adjust your legs so that the front leg is bent, and the heel
      of the back leg is raised. <br />
      <br />
      Lean your arms against the wall for stability and gently lower the heel.
      Hold for 20-30 seconds and then switch legs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>3. Quadricep Stretch</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Your quads are the muscles at the front of the thighs. <br />
      <br />
      When they get tight, your knees may start to turn inwards and contribute
      to abnormal gait patterns. <br />
      <br />
      To stretch your quads, sit on the floor with one leg bent back and the
      other out in front of you. <br />
      <br />
      Gently lean back until you feel the strain, but not pain. Hold for 20-30
      seconds and then switch legs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>4. Hamstring Stretch</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Your hamstrings are muscles at the back of the thighs. <br />
      <br />
      These muscles oppose the quads, so they also need to be lengthened to
      allow for regular hip and knee movements. <br />
      <br />
      To stretch the hamstrings, sit on the floor with both legs straightened in
      front of you and lean your body forward in a pain free range. Hold for 30
      seconds and repeat.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>5. Shoulder Stretch</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Raise one arm and bend it behind your head. <br />
      <br />
      Use the hand of your other arm to gently press the elbow back until you
      feel the strain. <br />
      <br />
      Hold for 20-30 seconds and then switch arms.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>6. Arm Over Chest</h3>
    <br />
    <img class="ex-img" src="${myImage2}" /><br />
    <p>
      Swing one arm across your chest and use the other arm to hold it in place.
      <br />
      <br />
      Gently press the arm towards your body, so it wraps across the chest more
      tightly. <br />
      <br />
      Hold for 20-30 seconds and then switch sides.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>7. Trunk Tilts</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Lay on your back and gently rotate your upper body to one side. The legs
      should not move. <br />
      <br />
      Hold for 20 seconds and then rotate your upper body to the opposite side.
      This exercise will stretch the sides of your trunk.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>8. Trunk Twists</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Trunk twists can be performed sitting or standing. Place your feet on the
      floor and keep the lower body stable. <br />
      <br />
      Gently twist your upper body to one side, hold for 20 seconds, and then
      twist to the other side.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Exercises to Boost Cardiovascular Health</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Cardio exercises can be adapted if you have motor impairments. Increasing
      your heart rate through cardio exercise pumping a few times a week is
      essential for maintaining healthy blood pressure.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>9. Wheelchair Aerobics</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      If cerebral palsy primarily affects your legs or one side of your body,
      wheelchair aerobics can be an effective cardio workout. <br />
      <br />
      It emphasizes upper body movement from a seated position.

    <h3>10. Dancing</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Dancing is an exercise that anyone can do anywhere and anytime. <br />
      <br />
      For cardio, turn up some lively music. It’s proven that music influences
      physical changes in heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and
      breathing.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Exercises to Strengthen the Muscles</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Strengthening exercises preserve bone health, which decreases the risk of
      osteoporosis and fractures.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>11. Wheelchair Pushes</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      For individuals who are affected by CP in the lower body, pushing your
      wheelchair is a great arm and chest strengthening exercise as well as a
      cardio workout <br />
      <br />
      Push your wheelchair instead of having others push it for you as much as
      possible. This is an easy way to incorporate strength training into your
      daily routine.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>12. Wheelchair Push-Ups</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      First, check that your wheelchair brakes are on. Then, sit on the edge of
      your seat with your feet flat on the floor. <br />
      <br />
      Place your hands on the armrests and press down to lift your body up. Your
      feet should remain on the floor and be used to support some of your
      weight.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>13. Resistance Band Training</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Resistance bands are available in many different levels of resistance and
      can be used for a wide variety of muscle strengthening exercis

    <br />
    <h3>14. Moving with Weighted Cuffs</h3>
    <p>
      An easy way to build strength is to wear some weighted cuffs around your
      wrists or ankles and go throughout the day. <br />An extra few pounds may
      seem like nothing, but they definitely add up over time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>15. Aquatic Exercises</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Have you ever noticed how much more difficult it is to move quickly in
      water than it is on land? <br />
      <br />
      This is because liquids have more viscosity (resistance) than gases.
      <br />
      <br />
      The extra resistance will help strengthen the muscles.

    <h2 class="za">Engaging Exercises for Kids with Cerebral</h2>
    <br />
    <img class="ho-img" src="${myImage3}" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      The best exercises for kids with cerebral palsy are the ones that your kid
      will actually want to do. <br />
      <br />
      Cerebral palsy describes a spectrum of motor disabilities caused by damage
      to the brain before, during or shortly after birth. <br />
      <br />
      It can be characterized by stiff movements, poor posture, and difficulties
      with balance and coordination. <br />
      <br />
      Therefore, exercise is necessary to help lengthen tight muscles, increase
      range of motion and coordination, and improve overall mobility. <br />
      <br />
      Due to their impaired movements, children with cerebral palsy tend to be
      less physically active, which increases their chances of developing health
      problems. <br />
      <br />
      This article will go over some exercises and activities your child can do
      at home to be more active throughout the day.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>How Much Exercise Do Kids with Cerebral Palsy Need?</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      It’s recommended that children with cerebral palsy aim to get at least 60
      minutes of physical exercise, 5 days a week. Although this may sound like
      a lot, not all exercise has to be boring. Physical activities can be just
      as beneficial (or even more so) than rote exercises. <br />
      <br />
      The best way to get specific exercise recommendations for your child’s
      unique condition is to speak with their physical or occupational
      therapist. <br />
      <br />
      This will help ensure that all the right areas are targeted and optimize
      your child’s ability to improve. <br />
      <br />
      Every case of cerebral palsy is different and each child will have varying
      recovery goals. Therefore, having an individualized exercise regimen will
      help cater to your child’s unique needs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Range of Motion Exercises for Kids with Cerebral Palsy</h3>
    <br />
    <img class="ho-img" src="${myImage4}" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Range of motion exercises should be practiced at least twice a day to
      reduce joint stiffness, promote circulation, and stimulate the muscles.
      <br />
      <br />
      All kids with cerebral palsy can benefit from range of motion exercises.
      <br />

      Children with severe cerebral palsy should participate in passive range of
      motion exercises. These are when a trained caregiver or therapist moves
      the child’s body for them, which stimulates and stretches the muscles and
      prevents blood from pooling in the limbs due to inactivity. <br />
      <br />
      When helping a child do passive range of motion exercises, be gentle and
      never force the body to move past its natural resistance. If your child
      says the exercises hurt or shows signs of being in pain, don’t try to push
      through it. Instead, only complete movements in their pain-free range.
      <br />
      <br />
      Children that have muscle control should be encouraged to do range of
      motion exercises on their own as much as possible. These are called active
      range of motion exercises. <br />
      <br />
      Some active range of motion exercises your child can practice include:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Neck rotations </strong>(rotate the head in circles clockwise
        and counterclockwise)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Head turns</strong> (turning the head side to side)</li>
      <li><strong>Shoulder shrugs</strong> (raise and lower your shoulders)</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Arm circles</strong> (spread your arms to the sides so that your
        body makes a T shape and then move the arms in circles forward and
        backward)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Elbow extensions</strong> (bend and straighten your elbows)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wrist rotations</strong> (hold your forearm with your other hand
        to stabilize it and then move the hand in circles)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finger clenching</strong> (make a fist so that all your fingers
        curl in and then straighten them back out)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finger parting</strong> (join your fingers together so that they
        touching on the sides and then spread them out as far as you can)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marches</strong> (sitting or standing, bend at the hip to raise
        your knee up like you’re marching, alternating legs)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lateral leg raises</strong> (lie on your side, raise your top
        leg up as far as you can, then lower it)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Knee extensions</strong> (sit on a chair and repeatedly bend and
        straighten the knees)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ankle rotations</strong> (rotate the ankles in circles)</li>
    </ul>
