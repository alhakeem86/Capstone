    <h2 class="za">Activities for Kids with Cerebral Palsy</h2>
    <p>
      The best activities for kids with cerebral palsy should encourage them to
      practice using areas affected by motor impairments frequently and
      consistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, children with poor hand control should practice using their
      hands, and those with balance difficulties should practice activities that
      require balance. The only way to improve weak functions is to practice
      them. While the activities may be challenging at first, they get easier
      with practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activity-based therapies are very effective for children because it keeps
      them engaged, distracted, and practicing the repetitions they need to
      improve their motor functions. Without further ado, let’s get into the
      activities:
    </p>
    <p />
    <h2>1. Arts and Crafts</h2>
    <img src="${myImage0}" />
    <p>
      Creative activities like painting, draw, and sculpting are excellent for
      developing fine motor skills. Fine motor skills involve the use of smaller
      muscles, such as those in your hands, to perform tasks that require more
      accuracy and precision. Art can also be a great way for children with
      cerebral palsy to express their feelings. Cerebral palsy can affect the
      muscles around the mouth, which can make it difficult for individuals to
      speak. Instead of verbally communicating, children with oral motor
      impairments may find it easier to draw how they feel.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Adaptive Sports</h2>

    <p>
      Participating in adaptive sports can be a great activity for kids with
      cerebral palsy. Not only does it promote an active lifestyle, but it also
      teaches children teamwork, sportsmanship, and goal building. Most sports
      can be adapted for individuals with motor impairments, so find out what
      sport your child is interested in and give it a try! To get started, check
      out the Paralympic Club directory.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Board Games</h2>
    <img src="${myImage2}" />
    <p>
      Board games are fun activities that encourage children to count,
      strategize, and take risks. Along with developing cognitive skills,
      children with cerebral palsy can develop their fine motor skills by moving
      their player around, separating money, and picking up cards. If you’re
      looking for a challenge, many board games have a “travel size” version
      that generally includes smaller components, requiring even more refined
      fine motor skills.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Karaoke</h2>

    <p>
      Kids with cerebral palsy that have speech impairments can benefit from
      singing. Singing is processed by a different part of the brain than speech
      and with enough practice, it may help your child improve tone,
      articulation, and flow.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Horseback Riding</h2>
    <img src="${myImage4}" />
    <p>
      Horseback riding is one of the best activities for kids with cerebral
      palsy because it promotes: Balance Strength Posture Coordination Range of
      motion Children constantly have to shift their center of gravity to stay
      on the horse. In fact, there’s a whole therapeutic practice based on
      horseback riding called hippotherapy. It’s designed to help individuals
      with disabilities improve their motor skills. As an added benefit,
      interacting with horses can also improve a child’s emotional wellbeing.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Swimming</h2>
    <img src="${myImage5}" />
    <p>
      Getting into a pool is one of the best activities for kids with cerebral
      palsy because it lets them practice moving around with less pressure on
      the joints. Water naturally has buoyancy, which is what keeps you afloat
      and makes you feel light. It helps you practice using correct form without
      bearing so much weight. This is especially great for children whose legs
      are affected by cerebral palsy, as it may give them an opportunity to move
      more freely than they are generally able to. Ever noticed how difficult it
      is to move quickly in the water? That’s because water has viscosity (fluid
      resistance). It helps strengthen your muscles and minimizes the impact of
      a fall.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Dance Party</h2>
    <img src="${myImage6}" />
    <p>
      Throw a dance party and play songs that have corresponding hand motions or
      dance moves. These movements are usually simple and repetitive, which is
      ideal for children trying to improve their motor functions. It will help
      your child anticipate, time, and coordinate their movements. Some examples
      of songs with hand motions or dance moves include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hokey Pokey</li>
      <li>Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes</li>
      <li>Hand Jive</li>
      <li>Cha Cha Slide</li>
      <li>Macarena</li>
    </ul>
